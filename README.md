This repo contains some of the projects I did during my masters at the Toulouse School of Economics.

Table of Contents
-
  - **Data Mining:** The objective of this project was to give an overview of the history of wind turbines in France. To perform a data analysis on their performance between 2013 and 2022. And to create a model to evaluate the power produced per wind farm by building a model to predict wind speeds at each turbine park.
  
  - **Functional Data Analysis:** The objective was to analyze sales data from 2017 to 2019 to have a good summary of the company pricing policy for the past years and a better understanding of the dynamics of the sales by using  functional data analysis, multivariate statistics, smoothing and functional principal component analysis (FPCA) techniques.
  
  - **Graph Analysis:** The objective was to investigate the spreading of a disease, an opinion, a behavior, information, or another transmissible resource, on a real network. We decided to work on the spreading of different contagious diseases on the air transportation flow of the United States before and
during the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively in 2019 and 2021.
  
  - **House Price Prediction:** This project was for the course Mathematics for Machine and Deap Learning. The project's objective was to predict house prices based on various features. The tasks included data exploration, variable selection, handling missing data, prediction algorithms, hyperparameter optimization, explaining predictions, clustering, and dimension reduction, with a focus on resampling, statistical modeling, and optimization issues.
  
  - **Non Parametric Models:** The objective was to explore cross-validation methods for Kernel Density Estimation, specifically focusing on Maximum Likelihood Cross Validation for bandwidth selection.
  
  - **Program Evaluation:** The goal of this homework was to reproduce key results of the paper of _Draca et al. (2011, AER) - Panic on the Streets of London: Police, Crime, and the July 2005 Terror Attacks._  The paper studies the relationship between police and crime by exploiting increased security presence after the 2005 London terrorist attacks using a  Difference-in-Difference (DID) strategy. 
  
  - **Scoring:**
      - **Bankruptcy:** The objective was to predict whether a company is likely to go bankrupt or not by using the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) method. 
      - **Marketing:** The goal was to build different models to predict whether a user will click on an ad based on the characteristics of the user.
  
  - **Spatial Econometrics:** This project explores international migration by first describing the available data, then analyzing aggregated emigration and immigration rates, and finally examining bilateral migration flows between country pairs.
    
  - **Web Mining:** The objective of this project was to analyze and describe part of the social web
graph of Twitter using web mining techniques to gain insights into how users connect and communicate, as well as the types of content that drive engagement.
