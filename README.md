  - **Data Mining:** The objective of this project was to give an overview of the history of wind turbines in France. To perform a data analysis on their performance between 2013 and 2022. And to create a model to evaluate the power produced per wind farm by building a model to predict wind speeds at each turbine park.
  
  - **Functional Data Analysis:** The objective was to analyze sales data from 2017 to 2019 to have a good summary of the company pricing policy for the past years and a better understanding of the dynamics of the sales by using  functional data analysis, multivariate statistics, smoothing and functional principal component analysis (FPCA) techniques.
